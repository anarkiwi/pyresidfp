# pyresidfp

Emulates the SID sound-chip in software. The C++ emulation code was copied over from
[libsidplayfp](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sidplay-residfp/).


## Thanks

I like to thank all contributors of `libsidplayfp`, especially:

- Dag Lem: Designed and programmed complete emulation engine.
- Antti S. Lankila: Distortion simulation and calculation of combined waveforms
- Ken HÃ¤ndel: source code conversion to Java
- Leandro Nini: port to c++, merge with reSID 1.0
